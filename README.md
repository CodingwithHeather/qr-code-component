## My process

I kept markup as simple as possible.. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned
More Flexbox practice and centering of items.. I felt like I coded this with minimal research.. a 1st for me.

### Continued development

I really struggle with sizing.. when to use em/rem/px etc.. I also want to re-code this with a css framework at some point soon..
